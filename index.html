    <p>Hello! My name is Jennelle Ashton, it might say Honda as my last name but that is my maiden name. I am 22 and I
      grew up in Rescue, California and I moved to Utah in 2022. I met my husband in March of 2023, and we fell in love
      and got married in November of 2023. We don't have any kids yet but we do have a Golden Retriever named Lonnie and
      a few chickens. When I am not working on schoolwork, I am taking care of our home, gardening, or spending time
      with family and friends. </p>
