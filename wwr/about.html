            <div class="grid-item"><p>Long before highways crisscrossed the desert, Utah’s rivers carved the state’s lifelines through canyons and valleys. For centuries, the Colorado, Green, and San Juan Rivers served as essential routes for Indigenous peoples, traders, and explorers. These waterways shaped the landscape and the communities that formed around them. By the late 1800s, rivers like the Green became popular with daring geologists and adventurers seeking to map the uncharted West. Today, their legacy flows on—not just as vital natural resources, but as thrilling destinations for adventure and discovery.</p></div>
            <div class="grid-item"><h2>History<img src="images/historyimg.jpg" alt="old river photo"></h2></div>
            <div class="grid-item"><p>Rogue River Rafting Co began in 1983 with one inflatable raft, a beat-up truck, and a dream to turn river thrills into unforgettable memories. Founded by two childhood friends who spent summers paddling the choppy rapids of southern Utah, the company started as a weekend passion and quickly grew into a full-fledged operation. Known for their deep local knowledge and contagious enthusiasm, Rogue River Rafting Co has guided thousands of adventurers through swirling eddies and sun-drenched canyons—always with a laugh, a splash, and a story to take home.</p></div>
