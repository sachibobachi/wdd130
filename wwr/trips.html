            <h3>The Lizard Lounge Float </h3>
            <p>4 hours total</p>
            <p> -Mellow Desert Vibes </p>
            <p> - Class 1-2 </p>
            <p>- Night Float Available </p>
            <p>Slow and sandy, this chill float winds through sunbaked canyons where lizards dart across red rock and
                time moves a little slower. Perfect for families or anyone who wants to drift and daydream. This is the
                kind of trip where you lean back, trail your fingers in the water, and watch lizards sunbathe on
                sandstone outcrops. You'll glide past ancient cottonwoods, sandy banks perfect for snack breaks, and
                maybe even catch a blue heron soaring overhead.</p>
            <p>This trip takes about an hour to get to the midway point where we will stop and replenish ourselves with
                snacks and drinks, The second half is about an hour and a half. </p>
            <p>This adventure’s a bit too wild for the little ones—participants must be 7 or older to ride these rapids.
            </p>

            <h3>Cougar Creek Crunch, The Hoodoo Hop </h3>
            <p>6 hours total</p>
            <p>- Wild and Winding with Bite -</p>
            <p>Class 3-4</p>
            <p>*Winter Floats Available*</p>
            <p>This adventure’s a bit too wild for the little ones—participants must be 7 or older to ride these rapids.
            </p>
            <p>Tight turns, splashy drops, and dense pine forest. You might not see a cougar, but you’ll definitely feel
                the thrill of the chase. Add a few guide-who-makes-you-laugh-too-hard moments, and it’s an instant
                favorite. It starts out mellow—calm waters, dry desert air—and then comes the slip, the flip, and the
                full-on belly laugh. This stretch of river is known for its surprise drops and “didn’t see that coming”
                wave trains. Great for groups that want a low-stakes thrill with a few unexpected twists, plus a killer
                story at the end. On the Hodo Hop, as you hop from one rapid to the next, you’ll be surrounded by
                towering red rock spires that look like nature tried sculpture for the first time and absolutely nailed
                it. This is the perfect middle-ground trip: exciting enough to get your adrenaline going, chill enough
                that you can still spot peregrine falcons overhead and strange rock faces grinning down at you.</p>
            <p>This adventure’s a bit too wild for the little ones—participants must be 13 or older to ride these
                rapids.</p>

            <h3>Wild Whiplash,The Inferno Fork, The Canyon Cosmos Cruise </h3>
            <p>-8-10 hours</p>
            <p>-Class 5-7</p>
            <p>-Desert Drama Meets River Rage then, Where the Water Boils and the Adventure Blazes next, Stars,
                Stillness, and Sudden Rapids</p>
            <p>This adventure’s a bit too wild for the little ones—participants must be 18 or older to ride these
                rapids.</p>
            <p>Mountain air. Crystal water. Absolute madness. The Wild Whiplash rips through snowmelt fed rivers with
                zippy turns, foamy rollers, and snowcapped views that’ll have you yelling “LET’S GO!” The Inferno Fork
                doesn’t just test your skill—it sets it on fire. Steep gradients, explosive hydraulics, and relentless
                whitewater come together in this beast of a run. You’ll thread the needle through tight slots, plunge
                over ledges, and emerge soaked and screaming (in joy). The red rock walls seem to radiate heat, the sun
                bounces off every surface, and the whole thing feels like rafting on Mars—if Mars had one hell of a
                rivereven before the first rapid. We'll start this one at sunset, end under a blanket of stars. This
                trip offers a peaceful float mixed with a few unexpected kicks, made all the more surreal by the fading
                light and night sky. Ideal for stargazers, romantics, or anyone who wants to whisper “whoa” instead of
                scream it. Watch as canyon walls shift from gold to purple, then dissolve into shadow. And just when
                you’re lulled into full peace mode—BOOM, one last surprise rapid. The stars always win.Spend a full day
                exploring the wild heart of the river. We’ll tackle a variety of rapids, enjoy a scenic riverside lunch
                and dinner, and still have time to soak in the views between paddling. It’s an immersive experience that
                leaves you sun-kissed, soaked, and grinning from ear to ear.</p>
